# GDB
<pre>
The GNU Debugger (GDB) is a popular, free, and open-source debugger for C and C++ programs, which is 
widely used in Unix-like systems. It allows developers to run, stop, and modify the execution of 
programs, monitor and modify the values of variables, and call functions independently of the program's 
normal behavior. GDB offers extensive facilities for tracing and altering the execution of computer 
programs, making it a powerful tool for debugging and issue resolution</pre>
